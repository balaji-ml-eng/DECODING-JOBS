## Features

- **Interactive Map** — MapLibre GL with real street/park/water detail, colorful company pins with hiring pulse animations, and a fast-blinking "NEW" flash when a role was posted in the last 3 days
- **Grid View** — a Map/Grid toggle switches the same filtered company set into a scrollable card grid, for browsing a whole city's roster at a glance
- **Spatial Search** — Companies loaded by viewport bounding box via PostGIS
- **Smart Filters** — Sector, stage, area, city, and hiring status, closed by default so the map stays full-bleed
- **Job Search** — Full-text search with autocomplete suggestions
- **Company Panel** — Only appears when you click a pin/card (floats over the map, doesn't reserve permanent screen width); shows logo, about/description, salary, work mode, sentiment (pros/cons), culture score
- **1-Click Apply** — Submit applications with resume selection
- **List Your Startup** (`/register`) — founders self-register their company and post roles directly, verified instantly by matching their work-email domain to the company's website (see [below](#list-your-startup-register))
- **AI Job Search Assistant** (`/assistant`) — chat grounded in this app's real data, resume upload + ATS scoring + iterative AI rewriting, and company/role-specific interview prep (see [below](#ai-job-search-assistant-assistant))
- **Application Tracker** (`/tracker`) — a Kanban board with email-based auto-advancement from forwarded interview emails
- **Logo Proxy** — Server-side, Postgres-backed favicon caching for company logos

---

## Prerequisites

- **Docker** & **Docker Compose** (v2+) — [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- **Node.js** 18+ & **npm** — [Install Node](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Git**

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Davidbala2004/DECODING-JOBS.git
cd DECODING-JOBS
```

### 2. Start the backend (Docker)

```bash
cd infra
docker compose up -d --build
```

This starts:
- **PostGIS** on `localhost:5432` — with schema migrations + seed data (auto-runs on first start)
- **core-api** on `localhost:8000` — FastAPI with hot reload

Wait ~30 seconds for the database to initialize. Verify:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
# → {"status":"ok","service":"DECODING JOBS Core API"}

curl http://localhost:8000/health/db
# → {"status":"ok","database":"reachable"}
```

### 3. Start the frontend

```bash
cd ../apps/web
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open **http://localhost:3000** in your browser.

## Environment Variables

### Backend (`services/core-api/.env`)

```env
PROJECT_NAME="DECODING JOBS Core API"
ENVIRONMENT=development
API_V1_PREFIX=/api/v1
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://decoding_admin:decoding_pass_dev@postgis:5432/decoding_jobs
CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:3001
```

### Frontend (`apps/web/.env.local`)

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

> `.env.local` is optional — defaults to `http://localhost:8000` if not set.

### Personal secrets (`services/core-api/.env.local`)

`services/core-api/.env` is committed (non-sensitive dev defaults only — DB password, CORS origins). Real secrets — `GROQ_API_KEY`, `SENDGRID_INBOUND_USERNAME`/`PASSWORD` — go in `services/core-api/.env.local` instead, which `infra/docker-compose.yml` loads as an optional overlay on top of `.env` and which `.gitignore` keeps out of version control.

**Never put a real API key directly in `.env`, in this README, or in any other committed file.** An API key is tied to your account's billing and rate limits — a key that ends up in a public repo gets scraped by bots within minutes and either runs your quota to zero or gets flagged and revoked by the provider's own key-scanning. Everyone who runs this project gets their **own** free key:

```bash
# services/core-api/.env.local (create this file yourself — it's gitignored)
GROQ_API_KEY=your-own-key-from-console.groq.com
```

Sign up free at [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com) — no card required — to get a key for the AI Assistant chat, resume ATS scoring, and email-based interview extraction described below.

---

## Development

### Hot Reload

- **Backend**: Source is bind-mounted — edits to `services/core-api/app/` auto-reload
- **Frontend**: Next.js dev server auto-reloads on file changes

### Useful Commands

```bash
# Backend logs
cd infra && docker compose logs -f core-api

# Restart backend
cd infra && docker compose restart core-api

# Full rebuild
cd infra && docker compose up -d --build

# Frontend lint
cd apps/web && npm run lint

# Frontend build check
cd apps/web && npm run build

# Stop everything
cd infra && docker compose down

# Stop and wipe database
cd infra && docker compose down -v
```

---

## Database

### Schema

Tables are created via SQL scripts in `infra/init-db/` (run once on first container start):

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `01-init-postgis.sql` | Enable PostGIS extension + create `companies` table with geometry |
| `02-init-jobs-users.sql` | Create `jobs` and `users` tables |
| `03-add-sentiment-and-work-mode.sql` | Add sentiment_summary, culture_score, work_mode columns |
| `04-init-applications.sql` | Create `applications` table |
| `05-add-real-company-fields.sql` | Add sector, stage, area, city, funding, etc. |
| `06-09` | Seed data — companies across Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad, Kochi |

### Reset Database

```bash
cd infra
docker compose down -v    # Remove volume
docker compose up -d --build   # Recreate from scratch
```

---

## Real Data Ingestion

Company/job data is populated via `scripts/fetch-real-jobs.mjs`, which pulls **real** postings from legitimate, ToS-safe sources (no LinkedIn/Naukri scraping):

- **Adzuna Jobs API** — free-tier, real India listings with real apply links. Adzuna's free/Developer tier is meant for evaluation and non-commercial use — check their current commercial terms directly before relying on it in a monetized product; it's a fine way to bootstrap a demo, not a long-term commercial data source.
- **Greenhouse / Lever public job-board JSON** — no auth needed, real, first-party postings straight from each company's own career page (not a reseller), so no commercial-licensing concern. Board tokens drift (companies migrate ATS or rename boards) and only work for companies that use one of these two ATS providers — see `KNOWN_BOARDS` in the script for the current curated, hand-verified list. Every entry was checked against the live API (not just "does the token resolve," since a resolving token can belong to an unrelated foreign company — verify the actual job `location` fields match before trusting a hit).

For cities the pipeline can't reach (most tier-2 hubs have very few companies on Greenhouse/Lever), the sustainable path is founder self-registration — see [List Your Startup](#list-your-startup-register) above.

```bash
cd scripts
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Fill in ADZUNA_APP_ID / ADZUNA_APP_KEY — free signup at https://developer.adzuna.com/

npm run fetch:jobs            # both sources, all cities
npm run fetch:jobs:adzuna     # Adzuna only
npm run fetch:jobs:boards     # Greenhouse/Lever only

node fetch-real-jobs.mjs --city=Mumbai --source=all   # a single city
```

Covers all major India tech hubs: Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad, Kochi, Mumbai, Pune, Delhi NCR, Kolkata, Ahmedabad. The script upserts companies by name and refreshes a job's `fetched_at` if it's seen it before, so it's safe to re-run.

Every run also sweeps for staleness: any pipeline-sourced job not re-confirmed by a run in the last `STALE_JOB_DAYS` (default 21) gets marked inactive, so listings that quietly disappeared from the source stop showing as "open." Statically-seeded demo jobs (no `fetched_at`) are never touched by this.

To keep listings fresh automatically, start the optional refresher container:

```bash
cd infra
docker compose --profile refresh up -d
```

This re-runs the fetcher on a 6-hour loop against the running core-api.

## Application Tracker & Email-Based Interview Tracking

The Application Tracker (`/tracker`) is a Kanban board (Saved → Applied → Interviewing → Offered) identified by email — no password, no login. Every user gets a personal forwarding address (`u-{token}@{INBOUND_EMAIL_DOMAIN}`); forwarding a company's interview email to it lets the backend auto-advance that card's round/status instead of clicking through manually.

**To enable email extraction** (free, no paid API key): set `GROQ_API_KEY` in `services/core-api/.env.local` (see [Personal secrets](#personal-secrets-services-core-api-envlocal) above) — sign up free at [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com). Without it, the webhook still works but logs an unmatched, unextracted event instead of erroring.

**To enable real inbound email** (needs a domain you control):
1. Point that domain's MX record at SendGrid.
2. In SendGrid, create an Inbound Parse route for it targeting `POST https://{user}:{password}@<your-api-host>/api/v1/emails/inbound` — embedding HTTP Basic Auth credentials in the URL is SendGrid's own documented way to secure an Inbound Parse route (it has no request-signing like their separate Event Webhook does).
3. Set `INBOUND_EMAIL_DOMAIN` (the domain from step 1), `SENDGRID_INBOUND_USERNAME`, and `SENDGRID_INBOUND_PASSWORD` (matching what you put in the webhook URL) in `services/core-api/.env.local`.

Until `SENDGRID_INBOUND_USERNAME`/`SENDGRID_INBOUND_PASSWORD` are set, the webhook stays open (so it's testable locally, see below) — set both before pointing a real domain at it. `INBOUND_EMAIL_DOMAIN` staying empty makes the tracker show a "not set up yet" banner; the manual "Next round" button on each card keeps working regardless.

**Test the webhook locally without any of the above**, simulating SendGrid's POST:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/emails/inbound \
  -F "to=u-<forwarding_token>@track.example.com" \
  -F "from=hr@razorpay.com" \
  -F "subject=Interview Invitation - Round 2" \
  -F "text=We'd like to invite you to a second round technical interview."
```
Get `<forwarding_token>` from `POST /api/v1/users/identify {"email": "you@example.com"}`'s response.

## AI Job Search Assistant (`/assistant`)

A third page alongside the map and the tracker: a Claude/ChatGPT-style chat assistant grounded in this app's own real company/job data (never invents a company or posting — every job/company it names comes from a tool call into the database), plus a resume ATS coach.

- **Chat** — ask about roles, cities, or companies ("Remote frontend roles in Bengaluru"); the assistant calls real search/filter tools and replies with actual result cards that link back into the map. Ask for interview prep ("prepare me for a Razorpay backend interview") and it pulls that company's real culture/sentiment data plus the real job description when one exists — general interview-format advice is clearly separated from that real data, never presented as a leaked/real question. Replies render as full Markdown (tables, headers, lists).
- **Resume Coach** — attach a PDF/DOCX resume in-chat (≤5MB, paperclip icon, no separate upload page); it's parsed to text (`pypdf`/`python-docx`) and scored for ATS-friendliness (0–100) with strengths/weaknesses/rewrite suggestions via the same Groq key used above. Ask it to rewrite the resume and it produces a full ATS-safe Markdown rewrite (single-column, standard section headers, plain bullets — no tables/graphics that break ATS parsers); ask for further edits and it revises that same rewritten version instead of restarting from the raw original, like any other iterative chat assistant. Re-analyzing against a specific job (via "Prep for this role" on any job card in the map's side panel, or by picking a resume while `?jobId=` is set) also surfaces missing keywords from that job's real description.
- **Chat History** — every conversation is persisted (`chat_conversations`/`chat_messages` tables) and listed in a sidebar, so you can pick up an old thread instead of losing it on refresh.
- **Identity** — same email-only gate as the tracker (`useIdentityStore`/`EmailGate`), no separate login.

Needs the same `GROQ_API_KEY` as the email pipeline above — unset, both chat and resume analysis reply with a friendly "not configured yet" instead of erroring.

---

## List Your Startup (`/register`)

A founder self-service flow — the primary way new companies and roles get onto the map without needing a scraper or an admin queue.

1. **Register the company** — name, website, sector/stage/city/area, optional exact office coordinates (falls back to a jittered city-center placement if omitted), and the founder's **work email**.
2. **Verification** — the founder's email domain must match the company's website domain (`you@acme.com` for `acme.com`). Personal providers (Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook, etc.) are rejected outright, and a domain mismatch gets a specific, actionable error — no admin review needed, but also no way to claim a company you don't control the domain for.
3. **Post roles** — once verified, the founder can add open roles directly; every posting re-verifies the founder's email against that specific company's domain, so only whoever controls the domain can add roles to it.

This is intentionally the long-term, sustainable data source for cities the scraper pipeline doesn't reach (see [Real Data Ingestion](#real-data-ingestion) below) — it's first-party (the company itself), has no third-party licensing concerns, and can't go stale the way an aggregated feed can.

---

## Deployment
